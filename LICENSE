BVER Community License (BCL)
Version 0.2.0

Copyright © 2026 Elrod Design and Engineering Group, LLC

“BVER” refers to the BVER software platform developed and
maintained by Elrod Design and Engineering Group, LLC.

1. Purpose

The BVER Community License is intended to keep the BVER platform freely usable,
inspectable, and deployable, while reserving the right for BVER to operate and
monetize generic BVER hosting services.

This license restricts how the Software may be offered, not where it may run.

2. Definitions

"Software"
The BVER software made available under this license, including executables,
source code, documentation, and associated tooling.

"You"
Any individual or legal entity exercising rights under this license.

"Platform Built on BVER"
A software system, application, or service where BVER is used as an internal
framework, runtime, or toolchain, and is not itself the primary product being
offered.

"Hosted Service"
Operating the Software (or a substantially similar system) as a managed service
for third parties where customers bring their own BVER-based platforms or where
the primary value offered is hosting, operating, or managing BVER itself.

"BVER Foundry Services"
Cloud-hosted sandbox, runtime, deployment, or operational services provided
directly by BVER or its authorized partners.

3. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this license, BVER grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license to:

- Use the Software for any purpose
- Run the Software locally, on-premises, or on self-managed cloud infrastructure
- Modify the Software and create derivative works
- Distribute the Software or derivative works
- Build, deploy, and sell Platforms Built on BVER

4. Permitted Uses

The following are explicitly permitted without additional permission:

- Internal use by individuals or organizations
- On-premises deployments
- Cloud deployments for your own organization or customers
- Contractors, consultants, or integrators being paid to configure, deploy,
  operate, or support BVER-based platforms for a client
- Selling, licensing, or operating a Platform Built on BVER as your own product
  or service

Deployment location (local, on-prem, or cloud) is unrestricted.

5. Hosting Restriction

You may not, without prior written permission from BVER:

- Offer the Software itself as a Hosted Service
- Provide a “bring-your-own-BVER” hosting or runtime service
- Operate a generic BVER hosting platform for third parties
- Offer services whose primary value is hosting, operating, or managing BVER
  for others

This restriction applies only to offering BVER as a hosting platform. It does
not restrict hosting or selling Platforms Built on BVER.

6. Patents

If BVER owns or controls patents necessarily infringed by the Software, BVER
grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive patent license to make, use,
and distribute the Software and derivative works, subject to this license.

If You initiate patent litigation alleging that the Software infringes a patent,
this patent license terminates.

7. Contributions

Unless You explicitly state otherwise in writing, any contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the Software is licensed under this same license.

8. Trademarks

This license does not grant permission to use BVER trademarks, logos, or branding
except for nominative or descriptive use.

9. Disclaimer of Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

10. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL BVER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER
LIABILITY ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

11. Relationship to Other Services

This license does not govern BVER Foundry Services, enterprise deployment tooling,
managed hosting agreements, or commercial support contracts. Those services are
governed by separate terms.

12. Summary (Non-Binding)

You may:
- Build with BVER
- Deploy BVER anywhere
- Sell platforms built on BVER

You may not:
- Offer BVER itself as a generic hosting service
