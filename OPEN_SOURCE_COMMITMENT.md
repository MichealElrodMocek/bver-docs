BVER Open Source Commitment

Version: 0.1.0
Status: Draft
Audience: Community, contributors, and customers

Our Commitment

BVER exists because open source exists. The platform was made possible by the work of thousands of developers who built the tools and libraries we all rely on.

We commit to an open ecosystem where:
- Core platform development remains open source by default.
- Monetization is centered on managed hosting, operational services, and enterprise support, not on closing the code.
- Contributors and plugin authors receive attribution and recognition.
- Platform users can trust that their systems will not be pulled out from under them.

Why This Matters

People invest time, energy, and trust into a platform only when they believe it will remain stable and open. BVER wants to be that kind of platform.

What This Means in Practice (Intent)
- Open source first: core repos are public and permissively licensed.
- Clear attribution: plugin authors keep their identity, provenance, and recognition.
- No lock‑in: users can run BVER on‑prem or self‑host without losing core capabilities.
- Transparent governance: decisions that affect the ecosystem are documented.

What We Will Monetize
- Managed hosting and cloud operations
- Compliance and enterprise hardening
- Deployment tooling and operational support
- Optional marketplace services

What We Will Not Monetize
- Hiding core platform code behind paywalls
- Breaking open contracts to force upgrades
- Removing community access to essential build tools

This Is Not a Legal Contract

This document expresses the mission and intent of BVER. We reserve the right to evolve details over time, but we commit to the spirit: open source first, community respect, and long‑term trust.

Licensing Intent (Non-Binding)
This section describes a current direction, not a finalized license.

Likely open source (permissive)
- On‑prem Sandbox
- Compiler
- Runtime
- Public SDKs (including EAGER Python SDK)
- Documentation

Likely closed source or restricted
- Hosted Foundry (cloud sandboxes and deployments)
- Deployment tooling for enterprise environments
- EAGER Event Bus service infrastructure
- Plugin library hosting/marketplace
- Hosted web apps for plugin publishing and EAGER management

We will publish a clear license and governance policy before locking any of this in.
